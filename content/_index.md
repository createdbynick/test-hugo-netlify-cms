    Studying from home doesn’t have to be a chore! Join our Virtual Cyber
    School, in partnership with HM Government, where you will gain access to and
    learn how to play CyberStart Game. Learn how to crack codes, find security
    flaws and dissect criminals’ digital trails whilst playing as a cyber agent

    ideas cyber agents apply when dealing with the aftermath of real cyber
    attacks.

    Enrol to the Virtual Cyber School and you will be provided with a FREE
    CyberStart Game license. With this, you'll be able to explore and have a go
    at over 200 cyber security challenges. Plus, you will be invited to join
    cyber security expert, James Lyne, for live webinars where he will use
    CyberStart Game to teach security disciplines such as digital forensics,
    cryptography and Linux. 





    By playing CyberStart Game, students with no previous cyber security
    interest or experience have gone on to master Linux fundamentals, write
    their own programs, and learn what it means to be an ethical hacker working
    in the industry. So what are you waiting for? Places are limited so make
    sure you reserve your place today and we will be in touch when our
    application stage opens!
