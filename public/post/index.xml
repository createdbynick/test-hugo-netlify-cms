      <description>Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s certainly good to know. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? They were just sucked into space. Computer, belay that order. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</description>
