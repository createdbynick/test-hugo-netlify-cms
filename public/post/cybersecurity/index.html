<h1>I recommend you don&#39;t fire until you&#39;re within 40,000 kilometers.</h1>
<h2>Brewing with a Chemex probably seems like a complicated, time-consuming ordeal, but once you get used to the process, it becomes a soothing ritual that&#39;s worth the effort every time.</h2>

<p>Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Well, that&rsquo;s certainly good to know. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? They were just sucked into space. Computer, belay that order. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I&rsquo;ve had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.</p>
