  Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Well, that's certainly
  good to know. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?
  They were just sucked into space. Computer, belay that order. Some days you
  get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss
  as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less
  bloody. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over
  again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.
  Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I will obey your
  orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the
  Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty
  to Starfleet.

Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Ensign Babyface! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I am your worst nightmare! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone We have a saboteur aboard.

It's jazz. and attack the Romulans. Your shields were failing, sir. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. I'll be sure to note that in my log. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Not if I weaken first.
